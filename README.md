# Microsoft Application Insights Output Plugin for Logstash
[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/microsoft%2Flogstash-output-application-insights.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/microsoft%2Flogstash-output-application-insights)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/logstash-output-application_insights.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/logstash-output-application_insights)
 
* This project is a plugin for [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash). 

* This plugin have to be installed on top of the Logstash core pipeline. It is not a stand-alone program.

* **This plugin outputs events to Microsoft Application Insights Analytics open schema tables.**

# Plugin Features

# Supported Logstash Versions

* Logstash 2.3.2
* Logstash 2.3.4

Note: 

* x64 Ruby for Windows is known to have some compatibility issues.
* the plugin depends on azure-storage that depends on gem nokogiri, which doesn't support Ruby 2.2+ on Windows.





# Setting up

## Install Logstash

  - Download logstash from https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash

```

### azure_storage_table_prefix
A prefix for the azure storage tables name used by this Logstash instance. Default host name
It is recommeded that each Logstash instance have a unique prefix, to avoid confusion and loss of tracking, although sharing tables won't damage proper execution.
If not set, the host name is used (not alphanumeric characters are removed, and converted downcase), if host name available.
The prefix string may contain only alphanumeric characters, it is case sensitive, and must start with a letter 
example:
```ruby
azure_storage_table_prefix => "myprefix"
```

### azure_storage_container_prefix
A prefix for the azure storage containers name used by this Logstash instance. Default host name
It is recommeded that each Logstash prefix have a unique prefix, to avoid confusion and loss of tracking, although sharing containers won't damage proper execution.
if not set, the host name is used (not alphanumeric characters are removed, and converted downcase), if host name available.
The prefix string may contain only alphanumeric characters and dash, double dash are not allowed, it is case insesitive.
example:
```ruby
azure_storage_container_prefix => "myprefix"
```

### azure_storage_blob_prefix
A prefix for the azure storage blobs name used by this Logstash instance. Default host name

# Enviroment variables

###AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT
Specifies the Azure storage account name
Will be used by the plugin to set the account name part in plugin property **storage_account_name_key** if it is missing
Example:
```sh
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT="my-storage-account"
```

###AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY
Specifies the Azure storage account access key
Will be used by the plugin to set the key part in plugin property **storage_account_name_key** if it is missing

```sh
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY="pfrYTwPgKyYNfKBY2QdF+v5sbgx8/eAQp+FFkGpPBnkMDE1k+ZNK3r3qIPqqw8UsOIUqaF3dXBdPDouGJuxNXQ=="
```

# Setting up Http/Https Proxy

If you use a proxy server or firewall, you may need to set the HTTP_PROXY and/or HTTPS_PROXY **environment variables** in order to access Azure storage and Application Insights.
Examples:
```sh
HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.org
HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy.example.org
```

- If the proxy server requires a user name and password, include them in the following form:
```sh
HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.org
```

- If the proxy server uses a port other than 80, include the port number:
```sh
HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.org:8080
```

# Setting up SSL certificates

When using SSL/HTTPS, typically log in or authentication may require a CA Authority (CA) certificate. If the required certificate is not already bundled in the system. it may be configured in the plugin (see above ca_file)
example:
```ruby
ca_file => "/path/to/cafile.crt"
```
